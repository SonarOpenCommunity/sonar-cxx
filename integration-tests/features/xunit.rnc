#
# The following is a grammar in Relax NG Compact syntax for
# JUnit-compatible report files which sonar-cxx is able to import.
# Many test frameworks are able to generate output which is JUnit-compatible
# or at least, 'JUnit-inspirated'. The following grammar
# combines the flavors implemented by JUnit itself and Googletest.
#
# It can be used to validate xunit-reports, i.e. to determine, if
# a report is valid according to the expectations of sonar-cxx.
# It can be done as follows:
#
# $ rnv xunit.rnc <your xml report>
#
# rnv is a XML validator which can be obtained here:

# The output from a single testsuite. The way how testcases are
# composed into testsuites is framework dependend.
element testsuite {
   attribute name { text },

   # This is our extension which helps to locate test resources. If
   # present, the value of this attribute is interpreted as path to
   # the source file which contains the testcases inside this
   # testsuite.
   # (TODO: test if both relative and absolute paths work)
